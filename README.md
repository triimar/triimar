### Hi there 👋
My name is Triin Marts, I am a software engeneering student (and soon to be graduate) of [42Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/) coding school.\
\
This profile showcases all the projects that I have successfully completed during my studies in the past 1,5 years.

For example, check out my most challenging project to date -  [Webserv](https://github.com/triimar/webserv), or a graphic project [FDF](https://github.com/triimar/FDF---Wireframe-model), that I had a lot of fun with. \
There is also a fully finctional "mini" shell - [Minishell](https://github.com/triimar/minishell), an integer sorting project called [push-swap](https://github.com/triimar/push_swap---sorting-data-on-a-stack) and many more!

 ✨Currently✨ I am working on the final solo project called Inception that is all about using Docker. \
 🔭🔭I am also looking for an internship, to put all my aquired knowledge to the test in the "real world".

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Triin Marts, I am a software engineering student (and soon to be graduate) of the [42Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/) coding school.\
\
This profile showcases all the projects I have successfully completed during my studies over the past 1.5 years.

For example, you can have a look at my most challenging project so far - [Webserv](https://github.com/triimar/webserv), or a graphic project [FDF](https://github.com/triimar/FDF---Wireframe-model), which I had a lot of fun with. \
There is also a fully functional "mini" shell - [Minishell](https://github.com/triimar/minishell), an integer sorting project called [push-swap](https://github.com/triimar/push_swap---sorting-data-on-a-stack) and many more!

 âœ¨Currentlyâœ¨ I am working on the last solo project called Inception, which is all about using Docker. \
 ðŸ”­ðŸ”­I am also looking for an internship to put all my acquired knowledge to the test in the "real world".

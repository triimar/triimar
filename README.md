### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Triin Marts, I am a aspiring software developer and a graduate of the [42Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/) coding school.\
\
This profile showcases all the projects I have successfully completed during my studies and a few personal projects I have made for further learning.

For example, you can have a look at my most challenging projects so far - [Transcendence](https://github.com/triimar/ft_transcendence) and [Webserv](https://github.com/triimar/webserv), or a graphic project [FDF](https://github.com/triimar/FDF---Wireframe-model), which I had a lot of fun with. \
There is also a fully functional "mini" shell - [Minishell](https://github.com/triimar/minishell), an integer sorting project called [push-swap](https://github.com/triimar/push_swap---sorting-data-on-a-stack) and many more!

 âœ¨Currentlyâœ¨ I am working as a junior developer, focusing on being more proficient in using Python and trying to find time for some small personal developing-fun.
